# EE462---DC-Motor-Driver-Simulink-Work
This is a simulation based project in which DC Motor driver application is done in EE462 course. In order to reach this achievement, a DC Motor will be driven by a rectified and filtered input voltage and using a chopper circuit. Therefore, PWM blocks will be implemented to use this chopper in four-quadrant. Also, in this project the concept of dynamic braking will be investigated. Moreover, controller types for DC Motor application will be investigated and they will be compared. At the end, devices will be suggested for this DC Motor driving application.
